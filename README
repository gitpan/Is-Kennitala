SYNOPSIS
        # Functional interface

            my $year  = year  $kt;
            my $month = month $kt

        # OO interface that doesn't pollute your namespace
        use Is::Kennitala;

        if ( $kt->valid and $kt->person ) {
            printf "You are a Real Boy(TM) born on %d-%d-%d\n",
                $kt->year, $kt->month, $kt->day;
        } elsif ( $kt->valid and $kt->comany ) {

DESCRIPTION
    A *kennitala* (Icelandic: *identity number*) is a 10 digit unique
    identity number given to persons and corporations in Iceland. This
    module provides an interface for validating these numbers and extracting
    information from them.

METHODS & FUNCTIONS
  new
    Optional constructor which takes a valid kennitala or a fragment as its
    argument. Returns an object that stringifies to whatever string is
    provided.

    If a fragment is provided functions in this package that need
    information from the omitted part (such as "year") will not work.

  valid
    Takes a 9-10 character kennitala and returns true if its checksum is
    valid, false otherwise.

  checksum
    Takes a the first 8 characters of a kennitala and returns the 9th
    checksum digit.

  person
    Returns true if the kennitala belongs to an individual, false otherwise.

  company
    Returns true if the kennitala belongs to a company, false otherwise.

  year
    Return the four-digit year part of the kennitala. For this function to
    work a complete 10-digit number must have been provided.

  month
    Return the two-digit month part of the kennitala.

  day
    Return the two-digit day part of the kennitala.

CAVEATS
    Only supports identity numbers assigned between the years 1800-2099
